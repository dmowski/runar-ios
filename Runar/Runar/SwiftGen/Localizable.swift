Sign prediction can apply to any field of activity for which a question was asked. Here, monetary gains are also possible, or a return of your debt, or some kind of impetus in the development of new plans and prospects, or in personal relationships. Very often, the appearance of this sign means a radical change in life or an exit from a difficult period.

It can also mean worsening health or job loss. But in any case, take this reality as necessary for you at the moment and learn from what is happening. Give up what has already become obsolete and become unnecessary for you. Deterioration in health indicates that you have neglected yourself and forgot about yourself, have become too carried away in pursuit of goals or relationships that are unnecessary to you at the moment. The rune calls to turn your attention to yourself. And remember that life does not stand still and soon everything will turn out for the best for you.

It is possible that the reason for this is that you were trying to get what you want at any cost. This kind of idea has completely absorbed your thoughts and soul. It is not surprising that now you feel empty and tired. Do not forget, no matter how great your vital resources are, they are still not unlimited. Here you need to understand your true desires and gravities.
        internal static let laguz = L10n.tr("Localizable", "description.total.Reverse.Laguz")
        /// At the moment, you should not count on any outside help. Analyze the circumstances and sort out the situation in order to reach out to yourself. Perhaps you see someone's evil intentions and intrigues on the way to your goals, but in fact, the reason for failure is in you, in the properties of your character and views. Also reconsider your desires and think how important the goal is for you.

        /// You were on the wrong track in your plans and outlined the wrong line of action. And if you continue this movement further, then you will face failure and disappointment. Despair and pessimism are now your companions. The main thing here is to refrain from blaming fate, others or circumstances. After all, the reason for your failures is within you. And perhaps it is she who will lead you to understanding and solving the problem you are faced with. It's not too late to admit and correct your mistakes. It is necessary to understand: what is happening to you now is just a reflection of what is happening inside. So change your subconscious orientations, control your emotions and actions, restrain the flow of negative energy. Maintain faith in yourself, avoid self-flagellation and discouragement.

Your business will not go as fast as you would like. Therefore, be patient and do not rush things. Sign advice - be flexible, do not obey conventions and old authorities. Now it is necessary to refrain from risky ventures and act only according to your inner feeling.

Break the old stereotypes and ideas, if you don't, you will steal your future. Live in the here and now, do not dwell on the end result of your current activities and do not cling to the past. The sign's advice is to calm down, do not resist and wait it out. Active actions of transforming your life will not lead to anything at the moment. They will only take a colossal energy consumption.

It is possible that the reason for this situation lies in the fact that you are clearly exaggerating your importance and ignoring external circumstances. Take a closer look and listen to yourself and your actions. Hasty decisions can only make the situation worse. Because by stubbornly following your own path, you can create even more serious problems..

Perhaps you have made a mistake in some way and your enthusiasm has dried up. Sign advice - look for the answer within yourself. Analyze the situation. In this case, you need to understand that the most important thing for you is to achieve your goal by any means and methods, going over your head. Or soberly assess the situation and take a different look at the solution to this problem. Find new approaches and ways to achieve the goal. To do this, you need to change your views on the world, without blaming those around you and not "evil" fate.

At the moment, the power of your actions is directed in the wrong direction and may turn against you. Here it is necessary to overcome the old clichés of seeing the situation and reacting to it.

However, try not to give in to doubts and keep your personality. The temporary absence of light in your life is just a given opportunity to learn to see in the dark. Do not allow insincerity in relationships with people, so as not to get disappointed and lose allies. The sign advises you to be very careful and not make hasty decisions.
