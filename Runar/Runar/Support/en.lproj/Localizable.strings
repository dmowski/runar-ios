She carries authority over the situation and power. The loss of the old occurs through the birth of the new. Therefore, you cannot work in the same direction. Your life has grown beyond its form and needs to change old habits and attitudes. Now you are able to destroy all obstacles on the way to the goal. But such overwhelming power can be dangerous.

It is possible that the solution to this problem will occur even through conflict, rupture, or some other extreme measure. Especially if a question was asked in the sphere of feelings, then this is definitely a solution to the situation through a conflict.

It is possible that the reason for this situation lies in the fact that you are clearly exaggerating your importance and ignoring external circumstances. Take a closer look and listen to yourself and your actions. Hasty decisions can only make the situation worse.

Give up what has already become obsolete and become unnecessary for you. Deterioration in health indicates that you have neglected yourself and forgot about yourself, have become too carried away in pursuit of goals or relationships that are unnecessary to you at the moment.

However, try not to give in to doubts and keep your personality. The temporary absence of light in your life is just a given opportunity to learn to see in the dark.

Here it is recommended to conduct some introspection and decide for yourself: do you really need what you so passionately desire and seek. Everybody has failures in life.

The stop has been given to you now to replenish strength and energy. Difficult situations will be overcome with the help of internal reserves.

This Rune is of an annual period, so it takes a certain period of time to implement the plan. You have prepared a fertile ground, sowed the \"seed\" of your purpose, and have taken good care of the development process. Now just watch out for the right harvest time. If you collect it before the due date, you will not finish the job. Blink - events that did not satisfy you earlier may repeat again.";

The rune says that there are or will soon be obstacles in the way of your business. But the difficulties that you are experiencing at the moment can have positive consequences, which will end favorably. The thunderstorm will pass by. It is possible that this sign was given to you now in order to test you, and not to deprive you of your strength. Therefore, one should not get upset and depressed because of a time delay. Just be vigilant and do not get involved in dubious adventures now, calculate your every step, be careful and persistent. Listen to your inner voice, to what your intuition tells you.

Sign prediction can apply to any field of activity for which a question was asked. Here, monetary gains are also possible, or a return of your debt, or some kind of impetus in the development of new plans and prospects, or in personal relationships. Very often, the appearance of this sign means a radical change in life or an exit from a difficult period. This suggests that you are thinking about the foundation of your destiny and want to renew your personality, get to know yourself and get rid of past misconceptions.

Perhaps new interesting acquaintances will be made, which will also benefit in spiritual development. However, it must be remembered that caution is required at any bends. In times of dramatic change, it is very important not to succumb to any emotions - neither positive nor negative. Maintain your ability to think soberly and be flexible in all circumstances. It is very important here that with any good impulses of the soul, you should not get off the ground, from your roots.";

Or soberly assess the situation and take a different look at the solution to this problem. Find new approaches and ways to achieve the goal.

Any of your plans should come true, but you should not think that everything will be presented on a silver platter. Here you should not rely on the will of fate, but rather work hard and look into all the corners of your soul - are there any darkened areas there. If you do not conduct this inventory now, then it is unlikely that the prosperity promised by the Rune will please you. This is something new that builds on the old foundation. Sign advice - that everything you do should be done carefully and with maximum attention to what is happening.";

These can also be external events that are beyond your control. And there may be your character traits that carry negative energies.

Get ready for favorable changes and a way out of stagnation, something new is already on the doorstep. This can be a change of place of residence or work.

Therefore, do not try to artificially attract attention to yourself with your behavior, even if it will hurt you. Don't expect rewards, but rather be flexible and humble. This is not a time for change, but a time for making plans and working with intentions. Everything will come to you in due time. Sign advice - refrain from excessive cash spending, be more modest and less selfish. No frills, and then you will succeed. After all, true happiness in internal and social life, the realization of the truths of human existence.";
"description.total.Reverse.Mannaz" = "At the moment, you should not count on any outside help. Analyze the circumstances and sort out the situation in order to reach out to yourself. Perhaps you see someone's evil intentions and intrigues on the way to your goals, but in fact, the reason for failure is in you, in the properties of your character and views. Also reconsider your desires and think how important the goal is for you.";

"description.total.Reverse.Laguz" = "You deny and challenge life itself. This sign is a warning against trying to exceed your capabilities. You are tired and your physical and mental strength is exhausted. It is possible that the reason for this is that you were trying to get what you want at any cost. This kind of idea has completely absorbed your thoughts and soul. It is not surprising that now you feel empty and tired. Do not forget, no matter how great your vital resources are, they are still not unlimited. Here you need to understand your true desires and gravities.";
"description.total.Inwaz" = "The business that you are currently engaged in will be completed successfully. You will easily deal with any problems and get rid of them, including unnecessary heart attachments. The sign speaks of the exit from the period of stagnation, the completion of one stage of life and the birth of a new one, which will transfer you to another stage of development - a higher and more favorable one. With the completion of the old, the new will come. But before the onset of a new stage, it is necessary to get rid of old attitudes and views, making room for a new one. This Rune symbolizes fertility and patronizes those who work on the earth. It also helps to get rid of infertility or male impotence.

This bright sign carries a great period of prosperity and happiness. All obstacles and fears have been overcome, and a new light enters your life. The sign indicates that now is the period when the most incredible desires can come true. But for this you need to decide on any serious life changes.

But this will require submission to the situation and willpower, only with such behavior can you move forward. The sign also indicates that the time has come to develop talents, but at the same time it is necessary to soberly assess your capabilities.

Fate gives you a warning through this Rune about the difficulties that you probably already faced or will face in the near future, as a result of trying to progress too quickly.
